<pstyle.color="blue ">The first version of HTML was written by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in <b><u>1993</u></b>. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in
    December 1999. Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language.
