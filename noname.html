<p>HTML is a Hypertext markup language that is used to create and organize content on the website or, we can say, the global web. <br>
It is also used to display the structure and layout in web browsers that form the framework for web In the early 1990s,a physicist named Tim Berners-Lee came up with an idea of how people could share and access information globally when he was working at CERN in the early 1990s.
His idea was the World Wide Web, which he made possible by introducing HTML in 1991.
HTML made it possible to organize documents using straightforward markup tags, allowing users to navigate between related documents easily.</p>
<h1>HTML1.0</h1>
<p>In 1993, Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, developed HTML 1.0, the first version of HTML.
The markup language was straightforward and created for basic text documents with hyperlinks.
HTML 1.0 introduced the html>, head>, and body> tags in addition to the anchor tag (a) for hyperlink creation.
</p>
<h1>HTML2.0</h1>
<p>
HTML 2.0 was developed in 1995. 
HTML 2.0 increased the functionality of web pages by supporting tables and image embedding. It also introduced the idea of user input forms.
</p>
<h1>HTML3.0</h1>
<p>HTML 3.0 was developed in 1995. 
HTML 3.0 was a draught specification with more sophisticated features like support for multimedia, style sheets, and enhanced tables. 
It was never broadly embraced, though.
</p>
<h1>HTML3.2</h1>
<p>
HTML 3.2 was developed in 1997. 
HTML 3.2 was the first widely adopted standard and brought about significant improvements. 
It introduced features like improved forms, support for multiple character sets, and frames for dividing web pages.</p>
<h1>HTML4.01</h1>
<p>
In HTML 4.01, we marked a significant advancement by providing better support so developers can easily use Cascading style sheets that are used to style web pages. 
HTML 4.01 introduced us to the use of elements like div and span to create a more precise document structure. 
HTML 4.01 has various variants to meet the requirements, including HTML 4.01 transitional and HTML4.01 strict.
</p>
<h1>HTML5</h1>
<p>
HTML5 marked a significant turning point in HTML development. 
It made it simpler to develop rich web applications by introducing a wide range of new elements and APIs for multimedia, graphics, and interactivity. 
Canvas, video, audio, and the scalable vector graphics element (svg) were important features. 
With elements like "header," "nav," and "footer," HTML5 also prioritizes semantic markup, making it simpler for search engines and assistive technologies to understand web content.
